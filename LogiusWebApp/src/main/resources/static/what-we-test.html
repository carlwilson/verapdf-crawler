        <h1>What this web application tests</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this application is to give statistics on the document formats published on a given
            website.</p>
        <p>When you enter a domain the application takes a sample of documents that are published on the corresponding
            website.
            Within the sample it finds and counts the number of PDF, ODF, OOXML and Microsoft Ofice files found.
            It also gives detailed information about the PDF versions and standards found.</p>
        <p>This application has two levels of use:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Simple:</em> without registration the application uses <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Bing
                search</a> to acquire a sample of maximum 1000 documents and does basic document analysis.
            <li><em>Advanced:</em> if you register you have the option to use the <a
                    href="http://www.crawler.archive.org">Heritrix crawler</a> to acquire a larger sample.
                Heritrix usually finds most of the documents on a website but uses more resources and takes longer to
                complete.
                The advanced application also offers the option to do an extended check of PDF/A formats using <a
                        href="https://verapdf.org/">VeraPDF</a>.
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>When you launch a query for a domain your job appears under the tab <a
                href="https://documentcheck.org/domains.html">test results</a> where you can see its status.
            Jobs can take time to complete. How long depends on the size of the website and the amount of documents
            found. When your job finishes you will receive a notification at the e-mail address you provided with your
            query.</p>
        <p>You can see the results of your job by clicking it in the list of jobs under <a
                href="https://documentcheck.org/domains.html">test results</a>.
            The <em>summary</em> gives the global count of documents found in PDF, ODF, OOXML and Microsoft Office
            formats. Under the <em>documents</em> tab you will find details on:
        <ul>
            <li>PDF documents by standard (PDF/A, PDF/UA, PDF/X, PDF/E).
            <li>PDF documents by version (1.X, 2.0).
            <li>Applications that have produced the PDF documents found.
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>You can download a report of the results in ODF format by clicking the <em>download report</em> link at the
            bottom right of the results pages.
            This report also contains the URLs of all documents found, organised by file type.</p>

        <h1>Options</h1>
        <p>By default the application will search for documents published on January 1, 2015 or later. You have the
            option to specify any other date.</p>
        <p>The advanced version of the application provides you with two additional options:
        <ul>
            <li>Use Heritrix for crawling. Heritrix is slower than the default Bing search but generally yields more
                complete samples.
            <li>Use VeraPDF for document analysis. VeraPDF checks whether a PDF/A document really complies with the
                PDF/A standard.
                Checking with VeraPDF can take significantly more time.
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Future extensions</h1>
        <p>This is a living project. In the future we're keen on extending the application with new functionality, for
            example:
        <ul>
            <li>Finding and counting documents in EPUB format.
            <li>PDF/UA and accessibility analysis. In the future we'd like to include testing for WCAG 2.1 accessibility
                and for compliance with the PDF/UA standard.
        </ul>
        If you have suggestions or feature requests please contact us.
